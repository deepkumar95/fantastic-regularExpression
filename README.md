How internal authentication is works in the form using regular expressions
This is the swing project in which I implemented the authentication which is used when we are fill up any 
form if we are not provide correct information then we will get some error invalid information This whole 
thing internally in the form is done by the regular expression so in this project we are use the regular expression
to implement this authentication
